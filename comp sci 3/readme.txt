Hey... Sorry for getting this in late, but I just do not like turning in
code that i cannot get to work. Because of this "flaw" lots of my assignments
remain not turned in because I'm not 100% happy with them. They may work, but not
how i want them to.

Anyways, decided I'd finally turn them in... here's the blockbuster homework....
