Hey,

Preston and I could not for the life of us get our char array's to pass to the child correctly... 

We also encountered several issues that didn't make sense, like our switch switch statements not working
even though we know that the syntax is correct.

We were able to get all the parts done that the program required, like seperating the arguments and passing them, but once it came to putting everything together, it all fell apart...

We were hoping that we could meet with you during office hours to discuss what he had overlooked so we are
better prepared for the rest of the semester.

In person we would be better able to explain our methods behind the programming, but we checked it line for line and could not find any issues. 


Thanks!
